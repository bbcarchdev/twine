  <section id="intro" class="section"><h1>Introduction</h1>
	
	<p>
	  Twine is a modular, queue-driven workflow engine for pushing RDF into
	  quad-stores for later serving as <i class="firstterm">Linked Open Data</i>
	  (LOD).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Twine consists of:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		  A queue-driven daemon (<a href="twine-writerd.8.html"><kbd class="command">twine-writerd</kbd></a>).
		</li>
	  <li>
		  <i class="firstterm">Processor</i> modules which are loaded by the writer daemon.
		</li>
	  <li>
		  <i class="firstterm">Bridge</i> components which feed data into the queues.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  The intention is that you will write your own processors and bridges to
	  support your particular application's needs.
	</p>
	<p>	  
	  Twine can use any
	  <a href="https://www.amqp.org/resources/specifications">AMQP 1.0-compliant</a>
	  message broker, and any
	  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/">SPARQL 1.1-compliant</a>
	  quad-store. In development, we use Apache <a href="http://qpid.apache.org">Qpid's</a> C++
	  broker and <a href="http://4store.org">4store</a>. Twine
	  uses the
	  <a href="http://qpid.apache.org/proton/">Apache Qpid Proton</a>
	  messaging libraries to speak to AMQP servers and
	  <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a>
	  to speak to quad-stores.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Twine is constructed with the assumption that the quad-store you use for
	  your RDF will contain one named graph per resource you intend to serve
	  to consuming applications. This means that retrieval can happen very
	  quickly and easily, but of course you can write processors which store
	  data in a different way if your prefer.
	</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="processors" class="section"><h1>Processor modules</h1>
	
	<p>
	  The role of a processor module is to receive a chunk of arbitrary data
	  and transform or interpret it such that the quad-store can be updated.
	  A simple case might be parsing a JSON or XML blob, creating some triples
	  from that blob, and then performing an HTTP PUT into a particular named
	  graph.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Twine includes a simple processor module which can parse quads in either
	  N-Quads or TriG serialisations, and which are processed by iterating
	  each of the named graphs in them and pushing them into the quad-store.
	</p>
  </section>

  <section id="bridges" class="section"><h1>Bridges</h1>
	
	<p>
	  The role of a bridge is to obtain change data from some source and submit
	  those changes as messages on the queue that the writer daemon listens on.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A simple bridge,
	  <a href="twine-inject.8.html"><kbd class="command">twine-inject</kbd></a>,
	  is provided: this simply reads data from a file and submits it as a
	  message. You must specify the MIME type of the file on the command-line,
	  which must be a typed registered by a processor module loaded by the
	  writer daemon.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A more complex bridge might wait on a change-feed provided by another
	  system, receiving updates and continually submitting them to Twine for
	  processing.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The rationale for splitting the processors and bridges (despite many
	  applications having a need for them to be tightly-coupled) is:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
		  the processor may need to have more involved interaction with the
		  quad-store than a simple push/replace operation, which wouldn't be
		  appropriate for a bridge, as it shouldn't (and indeed may not be able
		  to) access the quad-store directly.
		</li>
	  <li>
		  it should be possible to push the same format of updates (i.e.,
		  content types) from multiple sources, resulting in consistent
		  processing regardless of where the message came from.
		</li>
	</ol>
