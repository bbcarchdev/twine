/* Spindle is a co-reference aggregation engine which works as a
 * post-processing hook for Twine. When a graph is updated by a Twine
 * processor, Spindle examines the contents of the graph and looks for
 * owl:sameAs co-reference assertions. Where some are found, it generates
 * "proxy" entities within a named graph which connect together all of
 * the coreferences for a given source entity, and as more co-references are
 * discovered, they're also added to the proxy entity.
 *
 * For example, if graphs are processed which assert that <A> owl:sameAs <B>,
 * <B> owl:sameAs <C> and <C> owl:sameAs <D>, the end result is the following:
 *
 * <http://spindle.example.com/> {
 *
 *   <http://spindle.example.com/abc123#id>
 *     owl:sameAs <A>, <B>, <C>, <D> .
 *
 * }
 *
 * By collecting together the co-references in this fashion, it becomes
 * possible to deal with a unified view (stored as quads internally) of
 * a given entity described by multiple disparate graphs.
 *
 * In other words, Spindle constructs a topic-oriented index of all of the
 * entities processed by Twine.

/* TODO:
 *   Replace SPARQL query generation logic once supporting functionality
 *   has been added to libsparqlclient
 *
 *   Extraction of browse metadata for attaching to proxies
 *
 *   Class derivation should be described in RDF
 *
 *   Sifting/splitting on de-assertion
 *
 *   Same-origin policies
 *
 *   When a proxy is created or updated, proxies for entities referencing the
 *   entities it's a proxy for should also be updated so that new in-bound
 *   references can be properly proxied
