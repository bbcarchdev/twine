Spindle is a co-reference aggregation engine which works as a
post-processing hook for Twine.

When a graph is updated by a Twine processor, Spindle examines the contents
of the graph and looks for owl:sameAs co-reference assertions. Where some are
found, it generates "proxy" entities within a named graph that connect
together all of the co-references for a given source entity, and as more
co-references are discovered, they're also added to the proxy entity.

For example, if graphs are processed which assert that <A> owl:sameAs <B>,
<B> owl:sameAs <C> and <C> owl:sameAs <D>, the end result is the following:

<http://spindle.example.com/> {

  <http://spindle.example.com/abc123#id>
    owl:sameAs <A>, <B>, <C>, <D> .

}

By collecting together the co-references in this fashion, it becomes
possible to deal with a unified view (stored as quads internally) of
a given entity described by multiple disparate graphs.

In other words, Spindle constructs a topic-oriented index of all of the
entities processed by Twine.
